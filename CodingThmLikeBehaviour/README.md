# Coding-theorem Like Behaviour and Emergence of the Universal Distribution from Resource-bounded Algorithmic Probability

This repo contains the code I wrote for running the experiments presented in the paper [Coding-theorem Like Behaviour and Emergence of the Universal Distribution from Resource-bounded Algorithmic Probability](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.01711). I wrote the code in Python and Mathematica.
