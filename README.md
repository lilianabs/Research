# Research

This repository contains the code that I wrote (in Python and Mathematica) during my postdoc in Computer Science for running simulations. It contains the following directories:

* [**Automata:**](Automata/automaton.md) Contains the code of the implementation of a deterministic finite automaton.
* [**CodingThmLikeBehaviour:**](CodingThmLikeBehaviour/README.md) Contains the code that creates empirical distributions of computing models in the Chomsky hierarchy.
* [**CooperationPrevailsIndAdjustSocialTies:**](CooperationPrevailsIndAdjustSocialTies/README.md) Contains the implementation of the paper [Cooperation Prevails When Individuals Adjust Their Social Ties](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6742238_Cooperation_Prevails_When_Individuals_Adjust_Their_Social_Ties).
* [**Networks:**](Networks/WattsStrogatzModel.py) Contains the code for the Wattsâ€“Strogatz model.
