# Cooperation Prevails When Individuals Adjust Their Social Ties

This folder contains an implementation of the algorithm presented in the paper [Cooperation Prevails When Individuals Adjust Their Social Ties](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6742238_Cooperation_Prevails_When_Individuals_Adjust_Their_Social_Ties). It was implemented in Python using the library Networkx.

>Note: I wrote the code to run some simulations and compared the results with the ones presented in the paper.
